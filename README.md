# Econ-770---War-project

The fundamental relationship that this study will examine is how the result of inter-state disputes can be affected by each sides social, economic, and military capabilities.

This project had two main statistically significant findings. First, a .1 increase in Composite Index of National Capability (CINC) score leads to a 11.6% increase in victory chance. Second, a one million person increase in urban population leads to 1.5% increase in the likelihood of winning a war. These two conclusions were corroborated graphically by a bevy of histograms and choropleths.
